# **Wattway**

**Happy EV Journey!**  
Wattway plans trips for electric vehicles (EVs), calculates and finds charging points when your battery reaches 10%. Using the remaining battery percentage and mileage input, it shows reachable charging points and provides options for charging time. It also calculates the next lower battery point until you reach your destination.

## **Features**
- Display charging stations on a base map.
- Implement route planning for EVs with charging stops.
- Direction instructions and lane instructions.
- Waypoints feature to add multiple stops.
- Input for time to charge the EV.
